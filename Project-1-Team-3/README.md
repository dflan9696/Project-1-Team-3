Analysis: Are movie theatres going to survive COVID? How were theatres doing pre-covid? Streaming providers were making leaps and bounds in subscribers before covid, but Box Office Revenue was remaining steady and many good movies were coming out. So theatres seemed safe and steady for the moment. How are they doing post-covid? Movie theatres took a huge impact from emergency Covid-19 shutdowns with an over 80% loss in box office revenue/ticket sales in just a year. While streaming subscriptions have increased by hundreds of millions, and many movies only coming out on streaming services. A lot will need to happen for movie theatres to survive. Are they trending towards a recovery? With only a 15% increase in revenue in 2021 itâ€™ll be hard for theatres to survive but some are. The bigger theatres with a huge arcade, laser tag, bowling alleys have been growing in popularity over the years and might survive this storm.

Analysis: Did streaming services subs affect box office sales? Looking at the data we concluded that while streaming services subs increased, less and less people were going to theaters. Disney in 2019 announced that they would be moving all movie releases to their platform after a certain amount of time. This would in turn cause people to wait to watch these movies at home. Many of which would have been box office hits. As COVID restrictions winded down, there was an overall hesitancy to go back to the movie theaters. Thus bringing down the numbers for attendance and increasing the amount of people watching at home.
